# sudofox/hatena-ir-static

A collection of assets/documents related to Hatena's investor relations (IR).

See: https://hatena.co.jp/ir/index.html

This might take a bit longer for me to finish and for me to add automatic updates, as the way things are stored is a bit complex.

## TODO

- Find a way to assemble presentations stored on net-presentations.com with slides, notes, and timings intact
- Auto-update scripts + GitHub actions
- Maybe some tools to parse/interpret things to find interesting tidbits about the company
- Recover IR media for https://www.irmovie.jp/ir/?hatenacorp201609 (404)
